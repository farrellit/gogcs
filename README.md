# gogcs

copy data to gcs by piping it to this program's standard input.  

## Motivation

This program achieves the following goals:

* standalone binary should run without addtional dependencies
* standard credentials resolution
* data is streamed so arbitrary amounts can be supported (real limits undefined)


## Example 

```
$ make
tmpfile=$(mktemp); \
	trap "rm -v $tmpfile"  EXIT; \
	dd bs=1m count=10 of=$tmpfile if=/dev/urandom;\
	md5sum < $tmpfile;\
	go run gogcs.go develop-203820-junk test <$tmpfile; \
	gsutil cp gs://develop-203820-junk/test - |md5sum
